70. Projectile Motion Suppose a ball is thrown straight up in the air with an initial 
velocity of 50  feet per second and an initial height of 5  feet. How high will the 
ball be after 3 seconds? Note: The height after t seconds is given by the expression 
-16t2 + v0t + h0, where v0 is the initial velocity and h0 is the initial height.
