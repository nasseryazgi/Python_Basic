69. Corn Production Suppose each acre of farmland produces 18 tons of corn. How 
many tons of corn can be grown on a 30-acre farm?

70. Projectile Motion Suppose a ball is thrown straight up in the air with an initial 
velocity of 50  feet per second and an initial height of 5  feet. How high will the 
ball be after 3 seconds? Note: The height after t seconds is given by the expression 
-16t2 + v0t + h0, where v0 is the initial velocity and h0 is the initial height.


71. Distance Covered If a car left the airport at 5 o’clock and arrived home at 9 
o’clock, what was the distance covered? Note: Speed of the car is 81.34 km per hour.


72. Gas Mileage A motorist wants to determine her gas mileage. At 23,352 miles (on 
the odometer) the tank is filled. At 23,695 miles the tank is filled again with 14 gallons. How many miles per gallon did the car average between the two fillings?


73. Power Usage A survey showed that the average monthly electricity consumption  for a city was 750 million watts per month. What was the daily power 
consumption in watts of each resident? Note: The city has a population of about 
5 million people.


74. Square Deck José is building a square deck at the back of his house. José has a 
building permit for a 432-square-foot deck. How long will each side of the deck be?


75. Banks A bank offers 8.7% interest per year on all savings accounts. If a savings 
account initially contains $1000, how much money will the account hold two years 
later?

 97. Distance from a Storm If n is the number of seconds between lightning and 
thunder, the storm is n/5 miles away. Write a program that requests the number 
of seconds between lightning and thunder and reports the distance from the storm 
rounded to two decimal places . See Fig

98. Training Heart Rate The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that 
you maintain your training heart rate during an aerobic workout. Your training heart 
rate is computed as .7 * (220 - a) + .3 * r, where a is your age and r is your resting 
heart rate (your pulse when you first awaken). Write a program to request a person’s 
age and resting heart rate and display their training heart rate.

 101. Baseball Write a program to request the name of a baseball team, the number of 
games won, and the number of games lost as input, and then display the name of the 
team and the percentage of games won. See Fig.

and its purchase price. Two other marketing terms are

where the quotients are expressed as percentages. Write a program that computes the 
markup, percentage markup, and profit margin of an item. See Fig. 2.18. Notice that 
when the purchase price is tripled, the percentage markup is 200%.

  109. Analyze a Number Write a program that requests a positive number containing a 
decimal point as input and then displays the number of digits to the left of the decimal point and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. See Fig. 2.19

  110. Word Replacement Write a program that requests a sentence, a word in the sentence, and another word and then displays the sentence with the first word replaced 
by the second. See Fig. 2.20

111. Convert Months Write a program that asks the user to enter a whole number 
of months as input and then converts that amount of time to years and months. 
See Fig.  2.21. The program should use both integer division and the modulus 
operator.

  53. Server’s Tip Calculate the amount of a server’s tip, given the amount of the bill 
and the percentage tip as input. See Fig. 2.23

  55. Change in Salary A common misconception is that if you receive a 10% pay raise 
and later a 10% pay cut, your salary will be unchanged. Request a salary as input 
and then display the salary after receiving a 10% pay raise followed by a 10% pay 
cut. The program also should display the percentage change in salary. See Fig. 2.25.
